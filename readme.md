# Minimal application using OpenLayers + Vite

The application (min_ol_web_app) was generated by:
    npx create-ol-app min_ol_web_app

Then change into your new `min_ol_web_app` directory and start a development server (available at <http://localhost:5173>):
    cd min_ol_web_app
    npm start

To generate a build ready for production:

    npm run build

Then deploy the contents of the `dist` directory to the server.  You can also run `npm run serve` to serve the results of the `dist` directory for preview.
